/*
Memoization is a technique in which computed values are stored in order to avoid any potential redundant calculation.
Our first example will be a function to get Fibonacci number, which will also lead us to know which is the main difference
between DP and recursion.

Recursion consists in a function that calls itself within the function's body, and that's all. On the other hand, memoization
can also call itself, but it makes sure redundant computation is not performed whatsoever.

When calculating Fibonacci number by using recursion, more computation that needed is actually done. For example:
F(4) = F(3) + F(2)
Get F(3) first:
F(3) = F(2) + F(1)
F(2) = F(1) + F(0)
Now get F(2):
F(2) = F(1) + F(0)

So as we can notice, F(2) has been calculated twice. That situation may have been avoided if those results had been stored somewhere
the first time they had been calculated.

In order to accomplish the required prior calculations, two approaches may be followed:
    ·Bottom-top approach (tabulation): get from the lowest n to the target and calculate every solution for each of the values for n.
    ·Top-bottom approach (memoization): in order to calculate F(n), I need first to calculate F(n - 1) and F(n - 2). To calculate F(n - 1),
     I need to calculate first F(n - 2) and F(n - 3) ... and so on. It's the same approach as the recursion one, but solutions
     for each value of n are stored each time.

Note that for n: 4, 4 values have to be computated previously. In a general case, n values are required.
Therefore, a space can be reserved (by using a vector, for instance), in which those values could be stored.

Something that is worth pointing out (again), is that there is no reason to solve a recursion problem by using DP if involved calculations
are not prone to be repeated. For example, to calculate 1..n sum (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n), the function that solves it may be described as follows:
S(n) = 
{
    n               if n == 0 || n == 1 ;
    n + S(n - 1)    if n > 1            ;
}

Thus, for n == 3:
S(3) = 3 + S(2)
S(2) = 2 + S(1)
S(1) = 1

And as shown above, each calculation has to be performed just once, so there is no need to store those results each time.

Anyway, those can be easily stored as well in a variable that may be outside our function scope, so that there's no need to calculate it
again if it has already been done so. For example, if we have calculated first 5!, we need to calculate the factorial for any lower number.
If we wanted to calculate 3!, there would be no need to perform any mathematical operation again as it would have been already done.

Recursive approach: realise the pattern.

N(6)    = 2     = N(2) + 1  = N(0) + 1 + 1
N(7)    = 3     = N(3) + 1  = N(1) + 1 + 1  = N(0) + 1 + 1 + 1
N(8)    = 1     = N(0) + 1
N(9)    = 2     = N(1) + 1  = N(0) + 1 + 1
N(10)   = 2     = N(2) + 1  = N(0) + 1 + 1
N(11)   = 3     = N(3) + 1  = N(1) + 1      = N(0) + 1 + 1
N(12)   = 2     = N(4) + 1  = N(0) + 1 + 1
N(13)   = 3     = N(5) + 1  = N(1) + 1      = N(0) + 1 + 1
N(14)   = 3     = N(6) + 1  = N(2) + 1 + 1  = N(0) + 1 + 1 + 1
N(15)   = 4     = N(7) + 1  = N(3) + 1 + 1  = N(1) + 1 + 1 + 1 = N(0) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
N(16)   = 1     = N(0) + 1
...

Therefore, we can infere that:
N(n)    = 0 if n == 0
        = N(n - p) + 1 if n > 0, where p is the nearest lower power of two

For example, for N(5), p = 4 (2 ^ 2), thus N(5) = N(5 - 4) + 1 = N(1) + 1.
In the case of N(1), p = 1 (2 ^ 0), which leaves us with N(1) = N(1 - 1) + 1 = N(0) + 1 = 1
So finally, N(5) = N(0) + 1 + 1

As a consequence of having to find p, an auxiliary function should be designed to fulfill the mentioned purpose.

Memoization approach: similar to what we have already seen while talking about geeting an arbitrary Fibonacci sequence number,
many calculations can be avoided if they are stored in memory after they have been calculated for the first time. For instance,
we know that there's only one way to get 1 step further (jumping a single level). Same goes for 2 steps: we can only jump once
twice, or jump two levels above once (2 ways). So the proper approach here would be store those results and retrieve them
later if necessary.
Note that n == 0 is stored beforehand in the map we are about to use since it's the already known base case.
